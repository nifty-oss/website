Account","description":"Nifty Asset accounts represent non-fungible digital assets that are the heart of the Nifty standard. Each asset is represented by a single account: Asset. Here we examine their make up and features in-depth.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/attributes":{"id":"asset/extensions/attributes","title":"Attributes","description":"The Attributes extension allows creating a list of on-chain values (key/value pairs) for an asset. The on-chain aspect means these values can be read by other Solana programs and therefore be used by them (e.g., for gaming).","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/blob":{"id":"asset/extensions/blob","title":"Blob","description":"The Binary Large Object (Blob) extension allows storing generic data on-chain, such as images and documents. This data can be read by other Solana programs and therefore be used by them, e.g., for displaying the asset in a marketplace. While storing large amounts of data in a Solana account data is quite expensive, this extension gives the ability to create fully on-chain (FOC) assets for those who wish for them.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/bucket":{"id":"asset/extensions/bucket","title":"Bucket","description":"The Bucket extension allows storing generic data on-chain, similarly to a Blob extension. The main difference is that it is not necessary to specify its content type. The data can be read by other Solana programs, making it useful to store serialized (\\"object\\") data.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/creators":{"id":"asset/extensions/creators","title":"Creators","description":"The Creators extension allows adding a list of creators to an asset, specifying their status (verified or not) and a percentage share. In most cases, this extension is used in combination with Royalties to determine the addresses that should received royalties. There is no limit on how many creators can be added to an asset.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/grouping":{"id":"asset/extensions/grouping","title":"Grouping","description":"Assets can be part of an on-chain group (collection). A group asset is created using the Grouping extension, which specify the maximum size of the group (or indicates that the group has no upper limit) and its current size. Member assets of a group point to the group asset in their group account field.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/links":{"id":"asset/extensions/links","title":"Links","description":"The Links extension represents a generic way to point to off-chain data. It consists of a list of link pairs, each of which contains a name and a uri. This can be used to point to any additional off-chain data or resources.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/manager":{"id":"asset/extensions/manager","title":"Manager","description":"For use cases where the asset needs to be controlled (managed) by a third-party address, Nifty Asset allows the creation of \\"managed\\" assets. These assets have the Manager extension enabled, which defines a delegate address with customizable permissions.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/metadata":{"id":"asset/extensions/metadata","title":"Metadata","description":"The Metadata extension allows for assets to have on-chain description, symbol and uri pointing to off-chain metadata, for compatibility with existing NFT standards.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/properties":{"id":"asset/extensions/properties","title":"Properties","description":"The Properties extension allows creating a list of on-chain \\"typed\\" values (key/value pairs) for an asset. It currently supports three different \\"types\\": text, number (as an u64 value) and boolean. The on-chain aspect means these values can be read by other Solana programs and therefore be used by them (e.g., for gaming).","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/proxy":{"id":"asset/extensions/proxy","title":"Proxy","description":"In addition to extensions, Nifty Asset implements the \u2398Proxy Pattern to allow developers extend the program behaviour. The Proxy extension is used to identify accounts that are \\"proxied\\" &mdash; these accounts will be required to be a signer on instructions that manipulate them. Since only the proxy program can add the signature for the account &mdash; the asset address is a PDA of the proxy program &mdash; it guarantees that it is always called on every instruction and it is allowed to perform custom logic.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/extensions/royalties":{"id":"asset/extensions/royalties","title":"Royalties","description":"Nifty Asset offers the ability to encode royalty enforcement directly into its transfer instruction using the Royalties extension, where creators can specify transfer constraints and royalties percentage.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/features":{"id":"asset/features","title":"Features","description":"Nifty Asset is a fully-featured digital asset standard for Solana. It is lightweight and efficient, designed to offer a small footprint (compute units consumption) and be highly flexible. The main features of the standard are:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/allocate":{"id":"asset/instructions/allocate","title":"allocate","description":"Allocates an extension into an uninitialized asset (buffer) account. This is useful when the extension data is greater than the transaction size (~1232 bytes), which requires the data to be sent over multiple transactions.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/approve":{"id":"asset/instructions/approve","title":"approve","description":"Approves a delegate to manage an asset. It is possible to specify which operations a delegate can perform.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/burn":{"id":"asset/instructions/burn","title":"burn","description":"Burns an asset by closing its account and returning the rent funds.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/close":{"id":"asset/instructions/close","title":"close","description":"Closes an uninitialized (buffer) asset account, returning the rent funds. This instruction is used to close an account created by allocate, either because the asset was not created or the account was only used as a buffer for update.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/create":{"id":"asset/instructions/create","title":"create","description":"Creates a new asset by initializing an account. The asset can be initialized with or without extensions. To create an asset with extension data greater than the transaction size (~1232 bytes), you can use allocate instruction to add the data prior to create or update the asset after creation.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/group":{"id":"asset/instructions/group","title":"group","description":"Adds an asset to a group. A group is represented by an asset with the Grouping extension.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/handover":{"id":"asset/instructions/handover","title":"handover","description":"Handovers an asset to a new authority.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/lock":{"id":"asset/instructions/lock","title":"lock","description":"Locks an asset. When the asset is locked, it is not possible to execute an Approve, Burn, Revoke and Transfer instructions.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/remove":{"id":"asset/instructions/remove","title":"remove","description":"Removes an extension from an asset.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/resize":{"id":"asset/instructions/resize","title":"resize","description":"Resizes an asset account. This instruction is used when adding extension data over the 10 kilobytes account resize limit to an asset via the update instruction. While it is possible to add the extension data to a buffer (uninitialized asset) account, executing an update with the buffer account will require resizing the asset account over the maximum realloc limit &mdash; using this instruction avoids this limitation, since the asset account can be resized multiple times up to the require size before the update instruction.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/revoke":{"id":"asset/instructions/revoke","title":"revoke","description":"Revokes a delegate. It is possible to specify which operations should be revoked.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/transfer":{"id":"asset/instructions/transfer","title":"transfer","description":"Transfers ownership of the aseet to a new public key. When the asset or the group asset has royalty constraints associated, these are validated during the transfer.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/ungroup":{"id":"asset/instructions/ungroup","title":"ungroup","description":"Removes an asset from a group.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/unlock":{"id":"asset/instructions/unlock","title":"unlock","description":"Unlocks an asset previously locked.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/unverify":{"id":"asset/instructions/unverify","title":"unverify","description":"Unverifies a creator.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/update":{"id":"asset/instructions/update","title":"update","description":"Updates an asset.

The list of creators of an asset is specified by the Creators extension.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/instructions/write":{"id":"asset/instructions/write","title":"write","description":"Writes data to an extension. This is used when the extension data is greater than the transaction size (~1232 bytes), which requires the data to be sent over multiple transactions. The write instruction is used after allocating the extension.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"asset/overview":{"id":"asset/overview","title":"Overview","description":"The majority of NFT standards on Solana are built on top of SPL Token, which is primarily a fungible token program. A non-fungible is created by adding restrictions to fungible mints \u2013 i.e., for a mint to be considered \\"non-fungible\\", it must have supply 1, decimals 0 and no mint authority. As a consequence, NFT standards carry \\"baggage\\" from the requirements of fungibles to represent non-fungibles. For example, non-fungibles have a supply of 1 by definition, but you still need a separate mint and token accounts.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"quickstart":{"id":"quickstart","title":"Quickstart","description":"CLI","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}')}}]);
